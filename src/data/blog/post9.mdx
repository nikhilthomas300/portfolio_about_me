# Concurrency in Java

Java provides rich APIs for handling **multithreading** and **concurrent programming**. These allow programs to make better use of system resources and handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

> ⚠️ Concurrency is powerful but **hard to get right** — race conditions and deadlocks can ruin your day!

## Creating Threads

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

```java
Thread t = new MyThread();
t.start();
```

### Using `Runnable`

```java
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Runnable Task");
new Thread(task).start();
```

## Thread Lifecycle

1. New
2. Runnable
3. Running
4. Blocked/Waiting
5. Terminated

## Synchronization

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
```

## Locks and Executors

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    // critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
executor.submit(() -> doWork());
executor.shutdown();
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Race Conditions**
- **Deadlocks**
- **Starvation**

> ❗ Always consider thread safety when working with shared resources.

## Summary

Java offers both high-level and low-level concurrency APIs. Learn to use them effectively to build performant, responsive apps.
