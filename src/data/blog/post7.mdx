# Getting Started with Java

**Java** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability and strong memory management. It's widely used in enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems.

> **Note**: Java follows the principle of _"Write Once, Run Anywhere"_ thanks to the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

## Features of Java

- Object-Oriented
- Platform Independent
- Robust and Secure
- Rich API
- Multithreaded

## Hello World Example

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
boolean isStudent = true;
```

### Conditional Statement

```java
if (age > 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("Minor");
}
```

### Loops

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

## Java Class Structure

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Fields
    private int number;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(int num) {
        this.number = num;
    }

    // Method
    public void displayNumber() {
        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
    }
}
```

> âœ… **Tip**: Always follow naming conventions and keep your code readable!

## Summary

Java is a great starting point for any programmer due to its readability and widespread usage. Start experimenting and build something fun!
