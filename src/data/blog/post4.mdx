# Git Basics for Beginners

**Git** is a distributed version control system. It helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and manage code more effectively.

## Why Use Git?

- Track every change in your project
- Collaborate with team members easily
- Roll back to previous versions when needed

## Common Git Commands

```shell
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Check the status of your repository
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to a remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Best Practices

- Write meaningful commit messages
- Commit often but logically
- Always pull before pushing changes

Start using Git from day one on all your projects! ðŸš€
