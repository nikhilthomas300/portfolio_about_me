# Understanding JVM Internals

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the backbone of the Java ecosystem. It abstracts the hardware and operating system, allowing Java applications to run on any platform.

## JVM Architecture

```
+-----------------------------+
|    Class Loader Subsystem  |
+-----------------------------+
|     Runtime Data Areas      |
|  - Method Area              |
|  - Heap                     |
|  - Java Stack               |
|  - PC Register              |
|  - Native Method Stack      |
+-----------------------------+
|     Execution Engine        |
+-----------------------------+
|     Native Interface (JNI) |
+-----------------------------+
|     Native Method Libraries |
+-----------------------------+
```

## Class Loading

- **Bootstrap ClassLoader**
- **Extension ClassLoader**
- **Application ClassLoader**

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
System.out.println(classLoader.getClass().getName());
```

## Memory Areas

- **Heap**: For all class instances and arrays.
- **Stack**: For method calls and local variables.
- **Method Area**: Stores class-level data like method definitions.

> ⚠️ Heap and Stack are managed differently—stack is LIFO and thread-confined; heap is shared.

## JIT Compiler

The **Just-In-Time Compiler** improves performance by compiling bytecode to native machine code at runtime.

```text
Interpret → Profile → Compile → Inline → Optimize
```

## Garbage Collection

Java automates memory management via **Garbage Collection** (GC). Common GC algorithms include:

- Serial GC
- Parallel GC
- G1 GC
- ZGC

> 💬 You can tune GC via JVM options like `-XX:+UseG1GC`

## Conclusion

Understanding JVM internals is crucial for writing efficient, scalable Java applications.

> 🧠 **Remember**: What runs your code matters just as much as the code itself.
