# Getting Started with Bash

Bash is a powerful command-line shell used on Unix systems like Linux and macOS. It's great for automating tasks, running scripts, and managing servers.

## Why Learn Bash?

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Manage files and directories
- Create powerful pipelines

## Basic Commands

Here are a few essential Bash commands:

```bash
# List files
ls

# Change directory
cd /path/to/directory

# Copy a file
cp source.txt destination.txt

# Move or rename a file
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

## Writing Your First Script

Create a file called `hello.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

## Tips for Beginners

- Always start your scripts with `#!/bin/bash`
- Use comments (`#`) to describe what your script does
- Practice by writing simple automation tasks

Happy scripting! üêß
