# Introduction to CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a **layout system** for CSS that gives you control over both rows and columns, making it perfect for building complex web layouts easily.

## Why Learn CSS Grid?

- Create two-dimensional layouts (rows + columns)
- Simplify responsive design
- Align items easily without float hacks

## Basic Example

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
</div>
```

## Key Properties

- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `gap`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`

Learning Grid will level up your frontend skills dramatically! ðŸŽ¨
