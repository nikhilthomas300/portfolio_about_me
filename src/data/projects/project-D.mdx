# Introduction

Project AeroDeliver aims to automate the delivery process using drones equipped with advanced navigation and object detection systems. It reduces delivery times and operational costs.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Drones use GPS and computer vision for precise navigation.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Real-time object detection to avoid collisions.
- **Package Tracking**: Live tracking of deliveries through a mobile app.
- **Fleet Management**: Centralized control for managing multiple drones.

## Technical Insights

- **Embedded Systems**: Programmed drone controllers using C++ and ROS for real-time operations.
- **Computer Vision**: Used OpenCV for object detection and obstacle avoidance.
- **Cloud Integration**: Leveraged AWS IoT for communication between drones and the control center.
- **Mobile App**: Developed a companion app for users to track deliveries and provide feedback.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Navigation Accuracy**: Integrated GPS with computer vision to improve navigation in urban areas.
- **Battery Life**: Optimized flight paths to conserve energy and extend battery life.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensured compliance with local aviation regulations for drone operations.

## Outcome

Project AeroDeliver successfully completed pilot tests in a suburban area, demonstrating its potential to transform last-mile delivery. It received interest from logistics companies for further development.
